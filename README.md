## Description

This program was designed with with managers in mind who want to be able to quickly create a webpage with basic information for all of their employees. When users run this program, they are presented with a series of questions concerning the employees on a given team. Once all of the questions have been answered, it generates an HTML file that can be viewed to see an organized list of all team members.

## Installation

This program requires Node.js and NPM. Once these are installed, please run:
```
npm init -y

npm i inquirer

npm i jest
```
## Usage

For usage instructions, please do the following:

Enter node index.js into your terminal. You will then be prompted with a series of questions, concerning the members of your team. There are three types of employees that can be added in: Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Once you answer each question for one team member, it will ask you if you would like to add another user. If you select yes, it will go through the previous steps again. If you select no, it will generate a file titled team.html, that can be viewed to see the list of teammates. Each type of employee has its own picture in the card to make differentiating them easy.
